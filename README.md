# Web Scraping Alerta Rio

- This is my very first experience with web scraping.
- For this project, I used `Selenium`, dispite having imported `bs4`.
- The main objective was to download 25 years of temperature data at [Alerta Rio](http://alertario.rio.rj.gov.br/download/dados-meteorologicos/) website
- Alerta Rio is an entity at Rio de Janeiro that tracks all kind of natural events, such as floods and landslides.
- They manage it with meteorological data and pluviometer datasets.
- In the crew we can find several types of professionals, such as Geologists, Meteorologists and Engineers.
- They are monitoring Rio 24/7
